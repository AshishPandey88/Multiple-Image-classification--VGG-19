# Multiple-Image-classification--VGG-19
Classify multiple images in a folder with minimal code using keras API for VGG 19 image classification model.


"VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224"- Source-Mathworks
